Uses `chrono-node` to parse dates from text:
- "by Friday" â†’ Next Friday
- "next Monday" â†’ Next Monday
- "end of week" â†’ End of current week

#### AI Integration
OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Assistant not working**
   - Check if `.env` file exists with `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Verify API key is valid and has credits

2. **Gantt chart not rendering**
   - Ensure tasks have valid start/end dates
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Drag & drop not working**
   - Ensure you're using a modern browser
   - Check if JavaScript is enabled

### Performance Tips

- Large projects (>100 tasks) may slow down the Gantt chart
- Consider using task categories to organize large projects
- The AI assistant works best with 10-50 tasks
